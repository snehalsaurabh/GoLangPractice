#Notes

##Initialization
- Type 'go mod init "..."' into the integrated terminal.
- You usually type "github/username/packagename" in the '...' section.
- We are going with simply 'hello' which is the package name this time around.

##Creating a function
- main() is a reserve keyword.
- Go is a case sensitive language.
- Println is for printing.
- Methods from packages like 'fmt' have names starting with a capital letter like 'fmt.Println'.
- The code automatically imports the 'fmt' package for me after saving even though I didn't do it. 
- Go cleans the packages that we need or we don't need on the Go. 

##Running
- Type 'go run -filename.go-' to run the file.
