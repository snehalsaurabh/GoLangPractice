# Notes-2

## Initial
- Even if you don't initialise, it will work but we do that to get ready for the production ready stuff and it is considered good practice.

## Difference between Print.ln and Printf

## Range of Int - Types
- Go over to the Go Programming Language Specification and under Numeric Types, you can learn about the ranges.
- uint8 -> 0 - 255
- uint16 -> 0 - 65535
- uint32 -> some big number, idk
- uint64 -> an even bigger number - if you are reading this, consider opening the documentation by this point. 

- There are mentions of subtypes of float and complex as weel

### Aliases
- uint - either 32 or 64 bits - uint means unsigned
- int - same size as uint
- byte - alias for uint8
- rune - alias for uint32
