## Important Points

### Break
- As you can see, break statement is not required in Go.
- Switchcase in Golang only considers one case at a time by default unlike other languages.

### Fallthrough
- Instead of break, we have fallthrough keyword which does the exact opposite job of break.
- It is mentioned after the description of a case if you want to run the next case as well.
