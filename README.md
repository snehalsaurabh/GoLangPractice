# GoLang Practice
- Golang is a compiled language. Go tool can run directly, without Virtual Machine
- Executables are different for Operating Systems.

### What
- System apps to web-apps 
- Already in production

### Warnings:
- Don't confuse the code with other programming languages. 
- Similarity - C, Java, Pascal 

### Object Oriented:
- This is a mid way answer.
- We don't have classes in Golang. We have structs in its place. 
-  We don't have the following in Go: 
- Operator Overloading
- Classes
- Function Overloading

It is a simple language in its philosophy.

### Missing
- Try and catch is not present.
- Lexer takes care of that. 
- Semicolon is not present a lot despite the documentation mentioning the usage of semicolons. Lexer takes care of that for us.
